  <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Good day all! My name is Desmend Jetton and was born and raised in family friendly Las Vegas, NV.</p>
    <p>I moved to the Windy City via Los Angeles however, and I lived in Los Angeles for 7 years.</p>
    <p>Although I miss my West Coast Family, Chicago's opportunity, friendly people, awesome public transportation, and beautiful architecture make it my favorite city (thus far). I'm planning on visiting Hong Kong next year, so Chicago may become #2. </p>
